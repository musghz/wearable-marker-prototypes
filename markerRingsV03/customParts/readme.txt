Planar markers for testing on the motion bed. These markers are at a fixed diameter of 41.69 mm, which is the estimated wrist size of a 3-5 month old. The number of sides is varied from 3 to 8.

This version of the markers uses different construction. Instead of a box design, this is a layered design. Different layers are laser-cut and then glud together.
